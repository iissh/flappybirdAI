# Flappy Bird AI
AI plays Flappy Bird.

NEAT algorithm

starts off random no idea how game operates after many gens of slowing learning and getting better picks up on patterns on what it can do to get further in the level

NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies

after a few geneartions it starts getting exponentially better until it reaches a point that it cannot be beat level infinietly

neural networks come in layrers
first layer is input layer - what it knows and what it can see (the eyes of the AI)
insert a fram> based on this frame need a way to give information to  the network so it knows what is happening

position of bird from bottom and top piepe and bird y direction

ned to use this input info to get output output in this case is decision... jump?

pass values from input to ouput depending on those values we jump or not jump

connections and weights tweak these weights to make AI better
